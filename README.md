## **Skills**
### Communication and customer focus
- Managed all complaints that Natural Resources Wales received from customers, and coordinated responses with various teams and seniority levels across the organisation.
- Part of my role was to review all internal complaint responses before they were sent to the customer. I received a draft complaint response from a team manager; however, the response did not address all of the customer's concerns and was slightly defensive.
- I included comments and tracked changes to the document and immediately organised a 1:1 meeting with the manager to discuss the comments, provide suggestions, and tips for future responses.
- This ensured that the customer received an empathetic customer-focussed response which met their needs and addressed all of their issues.
- My communication and customer-focussed skills thrived through out my time at Makers Bootcamp, enabling me to work well with others. While creating our Project 'Acebook', I ensured that we met the given Minimal Viable Product (MVP) and user stories, keeping the customer at the heart of the project.

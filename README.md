## **Skills**
### Communication, Customer Focus and Collaborating with others
- Managed all complaints that Natural Resources Wales received from customers, and coordinated responses with various teams and seniority levels across the organisation.
- I reviewed a draft response from a manager, which did not address all of the customer's concerns and had a defensive tone. I included comments and tracked changes to the document and immediately organised a 1:1 meeting with the manager to discuss the comments. During this meeting, I provided points that still needed to be addressed and gave suggestions on what to include and how to phrase it, and tips for future responses.
- This ensured that the customer received an empathetic customer-focussed response which met their needs and addressed all of their issues. This was a great learning session for myself and the member of staff, and we developed a good work relationship.
- My communication and customer-focussed skills thrived through out my time at Makers Bootcamp, enabling me to work well with others and providing a great dynamic to the group. While creating our Project 'Acebook', I ensured that we met the given Minimal Viable Product (MVP) and user stories by always focusing back to these, keeping the customer at the heart of the project.

### Problem solving, Advising and Influencing
- While assessing an urgent complaint regarding staff misconduct, I noticed that the Complaint and HR teams' remit in the internal and external policies for these complaints was unclear.
- I organised a meeting with the complaints and HR team, emphasising the lack of transparency and clarity with the current process. After strongly advising, I was appointed to lead on the matter and wrote and produced an internal and external process for complaints against staff misconduct, which the Executive team agreed to and signed off.
- My initiative to solve this problem ensured that all teams were clear in their roles regarding staff misconduct complaints, were dealt with appropriately, and avoided any confusion or delay to the customer. My advising and influencing of the executive team's decision was the catalyst to enable the above positive impact and changes.
- During my final project 'Reef Runner', one of the first hurdles was creating and adding obstacles. Initially, the obstacles were being added to an array which decreased the game's performance significantly. After researching countless resources online, I discovered that by adding the obstacles in a group instead of an array, it would dramatically improve the game's performance.


### Attention to detail
- I received a Subject Access Request (Data Protection) from a member of the public where they requested their personal information. Part of the documents requested included other people's personal data.
- Firstly, I assessed what documents and information is relevant to the customer's request and what is their personal data. During my reviewing stages, I carefully examined all documents, marked and applied redactions using Adobe Acrobat Reader DC, and reviewed the documents several times.
- My immaculate attention to detail resulted in the customer receiving a correctly redacted document that satisfies their request while not breaching General Data Protection Regulation.
- During my project ‘Acebook’, I noticed that our comments were not appearing on our posts page, even though comments were being rendered on the comments controller. After analysing the files, I noticed that the comments needed to be rendered and accessed from the posts controller, to then be rendered on to the posts page. Therefore, within the function ‘find’ for posts in the posts controller, I called the populate method to access comments and defined a path to get the user's name that wrote the comment.

### Time Management
- Delegated all complaints Natural Resources Wales received. Complaints and Freedom of Information / Environmental Information Regulation requests must meet the deadlines provided by the Ombudsman Services and Information Commissioner's Office.
- I was responsible for assessing, investigating, and responding to a customer's complaint we received within 20 working days.
- Abiding by a procedure I implemented, I acknowledged the customer and sent the complaint to the relevant team within the organisation within 5 days. The team then had to send a draft response to myself no later than a week before the deadline, for reviewing.
- As a result, the customer received their response within the deadline provided by regulatory deadlines, avoiding any further complaints.
- For my final project at Makers 'Reef Runner', we had 2 weeks to design, create, present, and demo a project to an audience. My previous time management skills enabled us to carefully follow and complete tickets, and hold sprints and retros to reflect and plan ahead.

### Dedication and Discipline
- Over a span of 13 years, I dedicated myself to music by learning the Piano, Violin, and Harp.
- This included strict discipline by organising my own weekly practice sessions, to ensure I improved for each lesson and passed all examinations.
- After completing grade 8 in the Piano, grade 8 in the Violin, and grade 4 in the Harp, I can affirm that I have a strong mindset for learning and the commitment to see a journey through from start to end.
- Drawing from my discipline and dedication skills, this enabled me to complete an intensive 16 week Makers bootcamp and show that I am a committed and hard-working individual.
